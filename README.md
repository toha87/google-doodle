# Solar System Google Doodle
I always liked space in my childhood, I could spend hours looking at the sky and watching the stars. I even made a home-made telescope and used it to observe the moon and Mars. For this reason, I decided to make Google Doodle on a space theme. I want to make a solar system with planets, because the planets are round in shape, this will help me make the word Google out of them. Also, maybe I will add stars that will have to change their color and possibly move across the sky.
